This style of painting originated in France in the late 19th century. It emphasized light and color rather than precision of detail. Artists such as Claude Monet, Edgar Degas, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir sought to capture the immediate impression of the world around them, conveying atmosphere through bright and unexpected colors.
